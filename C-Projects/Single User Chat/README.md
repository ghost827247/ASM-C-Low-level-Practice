This is just a basic single User Chat between a client and a server, its my first project after learning Socket Programming In C
doesnt do anything special it just a quick 2 files i can peek at when i forget How To do Something

Compile with

    gcc -o server server.c
    gcc -o client client.c

    ./server <port>
    ./client <same port as server>

These are the resources i mainly looked at when learning (im still dogshit tho)
