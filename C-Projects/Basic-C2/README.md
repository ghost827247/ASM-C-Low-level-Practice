Want To Learn How C2s Work so figured id try make a extremly basic one

idk shit about web development apart from basic html/css either so its a good learning exercise
also i opted to sockets as libcurl isnt packaged with the C Standard Library

It is not even close to finished, shit doesnt work half the time
